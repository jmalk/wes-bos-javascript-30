    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    logAsString({players, team});

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    logAsString({players, team});

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    logAsString({players, team2});

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    logAsString({team3});

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    logAsString({team4});

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Things done changed';
    logAsString({players, team4});

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // logAsString({person, captain});

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 34});
    logAsString({person, cap2});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // The future's now!
    const cap3 = {...person};
    logAsString({cap3});

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    // This will change both because the copy was shallow.
    logAsString({wes, dev});

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
